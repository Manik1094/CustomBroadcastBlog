<h3 id='introduction'>Introduction</h3>
<br>
In previous blog we talked about Broadcast Receiver , in this blog we gonna talk about Custom Broadcast Receivers and how to use it in Android.<br><br><br>



<h3 id='custom-broadcast-receiver'>Custom Broadcast Receiver?</h3>
<br>

<b>Custom Broadcast Reciever : </b>In addition to responding to system events , your app can respond to Custom events also.For Custom Broadcast we need to define our
own actions in Intent object and broadcast it to receiver. We can send Custom Broadcast in three ways : <br>
<ul>
<li>Normal Broadcasts</li>
<li>Ordered Broadcasts</li>
<li>Local Broadcasts</li>
</ul> 

<b>Note: </b> We will be covering all these types. So , Let's get started.. 

<br><br><br>

<h3 id='normal-broadcasts'>Normal Broadcasts</h3>
<br>
These type of broadcasts are asynchronous in nature . Receivers attached to these broadcasts run in an undefined order , approx at a same time.
To send a Normal Broadcast create a new Intent object passing your own custom action into it and call <b>sendBroadcast(Intent)</b> method.
<br><br><br>

<h3 id='ordered-broadcasts'>Ordered Broadcasts</h3>
<br>
These type of broadcasts are delivered to one receiver at a time.The priority value in Intent filter decides which receiver to call first , When first receiver finished executing then it can propagate the result to second receiver and so on. 
To send an ordered Broadcast create a new Intent object passing your own custom action into it and then call <b>sendOrderedBroadcast(Intent , String)</b> method.  


<br><br><br>


<h3 id='local-broadcasts'>Local Broadcasts</h3>
<br>
These type of broadcasts are used when sender and receiver are in the same app . To send Local Broadcast create a new Intent object passing your own custom action into it and call <b>LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(context).sendBroadcast(intent)</b>.
<br><br><br>



<h3 id='CustomBroadcastApp'>CustomBroadcast App</h3>
<br>
We will build the simple app which contains three buttons. On Click of first Button we will send a Normal Custom Broadcast , On click of second button we will send a Ordered Custom Broadcast and on click of third button we will send a Local custom Broadcast.
<br><br>
Let's begin the coding.

<br><br><br>


<h3 id='CreatingThreeBroadcastReceiverclass'>Creating  three custom Broadcast Receivers class</h3>
<br>
Create three java classes "FirstCustomBroadcastReceiver.java and SecondCustomBroadcastReceiver.java for Normal and Ordered Broadcasts  and LocalBroadcast.java for Local Broadcast which extends from Broadcast Receiver class and override "onReceive()" method.".<br><br>

<br><br><br>


<h3 id='registeringBroadcastReceiver'>Registering a Broadcast Receiver</h3>
<br>
Open AndroidManifest.xml and register all the receivers class under application tag. For classes FirstCustomBroadcastReceiver.java and SecondCustomBroadcastReceiver.java declare the priority value in Intent filter , bigger the priority value first to receive a ordered Broadcast , also  under the intent filter tag add your custom action.<br><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Manik1094/7ec12b316a814104f4a88f82d1e22897.js"></script>

<br><br><br>

<h3 id='designingLayout'>Designing Layout</h3>
<br>
Open activity_main.xml file and add the following code.The layout contains three buttons on click of which we will send our Normal , Ordered and Local Broadcast.<br><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Manik1094/a8bbe3d86ab6e5e029a845f41e3a265f.js"></script>
<br><br><br>


<h3 id='implementBroadcastReceiver'>Implementing Broadcast Receiver in Activity</h3>
<br>
Open MainActivity.java file and add the following code , we are creating objects of our custom Receiver classes , button and defining our custom action . In addition to this we are registering the receiver in onStart() and unregistering the receiver in onDestroy() .<br><br>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Manik1094/9ff4e1c97afbb15e1a10d864e55aecc9.js"></script>
<br>
I would like to explain the above code . <br><br>
In onStart() method if you notice that FirstCustomBroadcastReceiver and SecondCustomBroadcastReceiver are registered using registerReceiver() method because these are Normal and Ordered Broadcasts , on other hand LocalBroadcast.java is registered using LocalBroadcastManager.registerReceiver() because this is the way to register the Local Broadcasts.
<br><br><br>

<h3 id='sendingBroadcasts'>Sending Broadcasts</h3>
<br>
Open MainActivity.java file and add the following code , on click of three buttons we are sending normal , ordered and Local broadcast respectively. First we are passing our custom action in Intent object and then sending Local Broadcast using LocalBroadcastManager.sendBroadcast() similarly we are sending normal Broadcast using sendBroadcast() and ordered broadcast using sendOrderedBroadcast() . <br><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Manik1094/86e8816189de40a262f521bacbffa549.js"></script>
<br><br><br>

<h3 id='receivingBroadcasts'>Receiving Broadcasts</h3>
<br>
Open FirstCustomBroadcastReceiver.java , SecondCustomBroadcastReceiver.java and LocalBroadcast.java and add the following code inside onReceive() . Inside this if action is equal to our custom action then Log message will be displayed.<br><br>

<div class="row justify-content-md-center">
<img class="img-fluid text-center"
src = "C:\Users\Manik Gupta\Desktop\normal_output.png">
</div>
<br>
<br>
The above image shows the Log message when normal broadcast is received , if you notice the receivers gets called approximately at a same time.
<br><br>

<div class="row justify-content-md-center">
<img class="img-fluid text-center"
src = "C:\Users\Manik Gupta\Desktop\ordered_output.png">
</div>
<br><br>
The above image shows the Log message when Ordered broadcast is received , if you notice FirstReceiver class is called first because it's priority is high and SecondReceiver class is called after FirstReceiver because it's priority is low.
<br><br>
<div class="row justify-content-md-center">
<img class="img-fluid text-center"
src = "C:\Users\Manik Gupta\Desktop\local_output.png">
</div>
<br><br>
The above image shows the Log message when local broadcast is received .

<br><br><br>




That's All! Happy Coding!
